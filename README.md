# Toronto_Parking_and_Socio-demographic_Observation

This project using the public dataset to answer the following questions:

1. 	Where do the most common infraction types occur the most?
  
2.	Are there alternative parking options available near the common infraction locations?
  
3.	Are there any socio-demographic trends of note in the areas with more infractions?


In this project the most common location for each of the top 20 ticket infraction types (1 location for each type) were found. After that the closest green P lot for each of the 20 locations were calculated by using Google Map API, the shortest distance were calculated as well. To deeply investigate the reason or any relevant socio-demographic observation. 'Neighbourhood Boundaries' data were used to plot the neighbourhood for the 20 common infraction locations. By analyzing the data of the 20 common infraction locations by using the datasets of 'Neighbourhood Profiles', the relevant socio-demographic observation can be noticed.
